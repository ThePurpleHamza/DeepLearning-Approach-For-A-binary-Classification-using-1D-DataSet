# DeepLearning-Approach-For-A-binary-Classification-using-1D-DataSet
# Overview This project explores a deep learning approach for binary classification using a 1D dataset. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify instances into one of two classes based on the input features.



# Dataset
The dataset consists of 1D data points, where each point has a single feature. The target variable is binary (0 or 1), representing the two classes we want to classify.

# Approach  


# Data Preprocessing:
Normalize the input features to ensure consistent scaling.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.



# Model Architecture:
Design a deep neural network architecture for binary classification.
Experiment with different layers (e.g., dense layers, dropout) and activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).


# Training:
Train the model on the training data.
Monitor training loss and validation accuracy to prevent overfitting.


# Evaluation:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


# Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to optimize model performance
